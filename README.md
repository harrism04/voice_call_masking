  <summary>üîë Required Resources</summary>

  ### Development Environment
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - [Ngrok Account](https://ngrok.com/signup) with:
    - [Authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/authtokens)
    - [Static Domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) (free tier includes 1 static URL)

  ### 8x8 Connect Resources
  - Connect Portal Account with:
    - API Key

##  üöÄ Setup Guide

<details>
  <summary>üê≥ Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)</summary>
  
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/harrism04/voice_callmasking_demo.git
     cd voice_callmasking_demo
     ```

  2. Set up environment variables:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Edit `.env` and fill in your credentials:
     ```
     EIGHT_X_EIGHT_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_connect_portal
     EIGHT_X_EIGHT_SUBACCOUNT_ID=your_subaccount_id
     FORWARDED_PHONE_NUMBER=your_phone_number  # Number to forward masked calls to
     WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_randomly_generated_webhook_auth_token
     WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=your_static_ngrok_domain  # e.g., https://your-domain.ngrok-free.app
     NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_authtoken
     ```

  3. Start the application:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```
     
     To check the status of your services:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
     
     To view the ngrok tunnel URL:
     ```bash
     curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels
     ```

  4. Configure webhook in 8x8 Connect console:
     - Set up your webhook URL as: `{WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/api/webhooks/mask`

The application is now ready to handle masked calls!

## üìö Try it out!

<details>
  <summary>Experiencing Call Masking flow</summary>

1. **Initiate Test Call**
   - Using your Source Number (test phone). In production this will be the client/service provider whose privacy need to be protected.
   - Call the Virtual Number (assigned in 8x8 Connect Portal)

2. **Observe Call Masking**
   - Call is forwarded to your Destination Number (`FORWARDED_PHONE_NUMBER`) - this could be a spare phone, a colleague, etc. In production this will be the service provider/client whose privacy need to be protected.
   - Source Number sees the Virtual Number as caller ID
   - Destination Number sees the Virtual Number as caller ID
   - Complete number privacy maintained for both parties
  
  > **Note:** In production environments:
  > - Source represents customer/patient/passenger phones
  > - Destination represents service provider/doctor/driver phones
